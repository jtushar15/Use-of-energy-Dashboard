# Use-of-energy-Dashboard

The problem of optimizing energy use for a company that supplies gas, electricity, and water in various locations is addressed in this project.

# Key challenges:-
Accurately track and control energy usage in a variety of buildings and areas.
Determine patterns, irregularities, and areas where energy use can be improved.

# My solutions:-
I created a thorough Power BI dashboard with sections specifically for gas, electricity, and water.
Patterns of Consumption: examined usage patterns over time and across buildings to find possible anomalies and seasonal variances.
Cost analysis: monitored annual expenses and pinpointed possible areas for cost reduction.
Interactive Features: made use of filters and slicers to allow for user-driven discovery.

# Technical Skills:-
Power Query: The powerful data transformation and cleansing features of Power Query were used to extract, clean, and convert raw data from various tables into a single, usable format for easy analysis.
Data Modeling: To produce a well-structured data model, use pertinent columns to establish relationships between tables.
DAX Measures: To compute key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for energy analysis, custom DAX measures were created.

# Impact:-
I can create a more sustainable future by utilizing Power BI's capabilities and my expertise in data analysis.
